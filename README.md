PredictHer

PredictHer aims to empower women by providing data-driven health forecasts for three significant diseases: heart disease, breast cancer, and diabetes. The project develops distinct machine-learning models for each disease and trains them to achieve high accuracy. By merging the machine learning models with a front-end interface using an API, PredictHer offers women a platform to assess their health without fear or stigma, especially in cases such as ovarian or breast.
During the course of our project development, we encountered significant hurdles in integrating the machine learning code with the project's front end. Despite investing a substantial amount of time in training the machine learning model over an extended period, we found ourselves grappling with this integration challenge. However, through perseverance and resourcefulness, we ultimately overcame these obstacles.
